# Motivation
This is my senior project in Computer Science at KU. 
I developed it with my friend, Thongthai RUJIWETWONG. 
The inspiration for this app came from the K-drama "Love Alarm", 
and its features are similar to those in the K-drama. Currently, 
it's just a demo and can only be used at Kasetsart University.
However, you can try it by downloading the APK file.
